# Specification Quality Checklist: Expense Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-07-09  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on first iteration (2026-07-09).
- API Dependencies section names backend capabilities at contract level (required by Constitution Principle XXII) without prescribing frontend file structure or framework usage beyond what the user explicitly scoped as constraints in the feature brief.
- Delete vs archive handled as conditional capabilities per Backend P007 exposure; no open clarification markers required.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan` or optional `/speckit-clarify` if stakeholders want to refine dashboard scope before planning.
