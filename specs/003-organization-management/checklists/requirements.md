# Specification Quality Checklist: Organization Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Constitution-mandated sections**: Per Principle XXII, this spec documents API
  Dependencies, UI States, Responsive Behavior, Page Layout, Empty States, Validation
  Rules, and Error Scenarios. Backend endpoint paths are expressed as assumed RESTful
  conventions to be reconciled with the Backend P002 OpenAPI contract during `/speckit-plan`;
  they are dependencies, not implementation prescriptions.
- **Technology references**: Framework and library names in cross-cutting requirements
  (TanStack Query, Axios, React Hook Form, Zod) restate binding Constitution architectural
  mandates the feature must comply with, not new design choices.
- **Relationship fields**: Warehouse branch assignment and vehicle associations are
  documented as backend-driven; exact form fields deferred to planning against OpenAPI.
- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
